Feature: Error Handling for Login
  As a user of the Sauce Labs Demo website
  I want to test error handling during login
  So that I can ensure appropriate error messages are displayed

  Scenario: Login without a username
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user leaves the username blank
    And enters "secret_sauce" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Username is required."

  Scenario: Login without a password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "standard_user" as the username
    And leaves the password blank
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Password is required."

  Scenario: Login with invalid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "invalid_user" as the username
    And enters "wrong_password" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Username and password do not match any user in this service."
