Feature: Sorting and Filters
  As a user of the Sauce Labs Demo website
  I want to test sorting and filtering features
  So that I can ensure they work as expected

  Scenario: Sort products by name (A to Z)
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user selects "Name (A to Z)" from the sorting dropdown
    Then the products should be displayed in alphabetical order

  Scenario: Sort products by name (Z to A)
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user selects "Name (Z to A)" from the sorting dropdown
    Then the products should be displayed in inverted-alphabetical order  

  Scenario: Sort products by price (high to low)
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user selects "Price (high to low)" from the sorting dropdown
    Then the products should be displayed in ascending order of price
    
  Scenario: Sort products by price (low to high)
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user selects "Price (low to high)" from the sorting dropdown
    Then the products should be displayed in descending order of price
