Feature: Sorting and Filters
  As a user of the Sauce Labs Demo website
  I want to test sorting and filtering features
  So that I can ensure they work as expected

  Scenario: Sort products by price (low to high)
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user selects "Price (low to high)" from the sorting dropdown
    Then the products should be displayed in ascending order of price

  Scenario: Sort products by name (A to Z)
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user selects "Name (A to Z)" from the sorting dropdown
    Then the products should be displayed in alphabetical order

  Scenario: Filter products by specific category
    Given the user is on the products page
    When the user applies the "Onesie" filter
    Then only the "Sauce Labs Onesie" should be displayed
